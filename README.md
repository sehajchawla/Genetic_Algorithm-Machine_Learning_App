# Genetic Algorithm - Machine Learning App
In this project I build a Gamma Radiation Classifier and use Genetic Programming to pick the best Machine Learning model + hyper-parameters.

The dataset was from the actual MAGIC Gamma Telescope.

The output is in two forms, both in PNG format, and shows the results.

The first output shows that the model is chose was the gradient boosting algorithm, and the second output shows us that the algorithm also chose the best hyperparameters like learning rate and estimators!
